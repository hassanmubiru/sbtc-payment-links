# Stacks API Integration Summary

## Overview
The sBTC Payment Links application has been successfully integrated with the Stacks API to provide real-time blockchain functionality and enhanced user experience.

## Features Added

### 1. Real-time Address Validation
- **File**: `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Validates Stacks addresses using the live API
- **Benefits**: 
  - Prevents errors from invalid addresses
  - Shows real-time validation status with visual indicators
  - Displays current STX balance for valid addresses

### 2. Network Status Monitor
- **File**: `src/components/NetworkStatus.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Displays live Stacks network information
- **Shows**:
  - Current block height
  - Burn block height
  - Network type (mainnet/testnet)
  - Peer version
  - Connection status

### 3. Transaction Monitoring
- **File**: `src/components/TransactionMonitor.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Monitors for incoming payments to recipient addresses
- **Features**:
  - Real-time transaction checking
  - Payment confirmation notifications
  - Recent transaction history
  - Direct links to Stacks Explorer

### 4. Enhanced API Utilities
- **File**: `src/utils/stacksApi.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `validateStacksAddressWithApi()` - API-based address validation
  - `getAddressBalance()` - Fetch STX balance
  - `getAddressTransactions()` - Get transaction history
  - `getTransactionById()` - Fetch specific transaction details
  - `getCurrentBlockHeight()` - Get current blockchain height
  - `getNetworkInfo()` - Network status information
  - `checkSufficientBalance()` - Verify payment capability

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_NETWORK=mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_API_URL=https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co
```

### Dependencies Added
- `@stacks/connect` - Stacks wallet integration
- `@stacks/network` - Network configuration
- `@stacks/transactions` - Transaction utilities
- `@stacks/common` - Common utilities
- `qrcode` - QR code generation
- `@types/qrcode` - TypeScript types

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Smart Form Validation
- Real-time address validation with visual feedback
- Balance checking for recipient addresses
- Prevents invalid payment requests

### 2. Live Network Information
- Shows current blockchain status
- Network health indicators
- Automatic updates every 30 seconds

### 3. Payment Monitoring
- Optional transaction monitoring for payments
- Real-time payment confirmations
- Transaction history display

### 4. Enhanced Payment Preview
- QR code generation for easy mobile payments
- Multiple sharing options
- Direct links to blockchain explorer

## API Integration Benefits

1. **Real-time Validation**: Prevents user errors with live address checking
2. **Balance Awareness**: Shows recipient balance for transparency
3. **Network Status**: Displays blockchain health and connectivity
4. **Transaction Tracking**: Monitors for payment completion
5. **Explorer Integration**: Direct links to transaction details

## Security Considerations

- All API calls are made from the client-side
- No private keys or sensitive data are transmitted
- Address validation uses public blockchain data only
- Rate limiting is handled through debounced API calls

## Usage

The application now provides a complete sBTC payment experience:

1. **Create Payment**: Enter amount, recipient, and optional details
2. **Validate**: Real-time address validation and balance checking
3. **Generate**: Create shareable payment URLs and QR codes
4. **Monitor**: Track payment completion (optional)
5. **Share**: Multiple sharing options for payment requests

## Development Server

The application is now running at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3001
- **Network**: http://10.107.4.35:3001

All Stacks API features are fully functional and ready for testing!
